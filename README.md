### "Greetings" - Tekhartha Zenyatta ðŸ‘‹

I'm CactusPuppy, and I build tools for people, communities, and companies to use. I currently work with [Elo Hell Esports](https://elohell.gg/) in their Overwatch Workshop division, and I'm also developing data analysis tools for [Anwita Biosciences](https://anwitabio.com) (I made Anwita Biosciences' website too!). On the side, you can find me making small game mods and videos.

I co-founded [@GrandeurHammers](https://github.com/GrandeurHammers), graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science, and spend way too much time fiddling with configurations and themes.

### Featured Projects
#### [Workshop.codes](https://workshop.codes)
[![Workshop.codes](/workshop.codes.png)](https://workshop.codes)
Workshop.codes is an online repository for Overwatch Workshop creations. The Workshop allows users to customize their gameplay experience in the game of Overwatch, and Workshop.codes helps creators of these custom gameplay experiences share their creations with the world.

Workshop.codes runs on Ruby on Rails, is continuously deployed to Heroku, and utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous testing. More information on Workshop.codes' technology stack can be found on the [project GitHub](https://github.com/EloHellEsports/Workshop.codes).

I am an active contributor to this site, and am responsible for introducing standardized content ancestry attribution (think GitHub's fork system or Thingiverse's remix/mashup system), allowing creators to easily provide credit to other creators. In addition, I added several behind-the-scenes features, including behavior testing with Cucumber (enabling the development team as a whole to catch major errors before deployment).
